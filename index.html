I worked as a Teaching Assistant in my department and finished an internship at <a href="http://www.thetechacademy.net/">The Tech Academy</a>, where I developed and introduced new content for course materials in electronics and programming. As a research assistant, I worked under <a href="http://ece.northsouth.edu/people/lamia-iftekhar/">Dr. Lamia Iftekhar</a> on a funded project named "Area Coverage Algorithms for Networked Multi-robot Systems," where my role was to construct the hardware model. During my undergraduate years, I was also associated with IEEE, where I was elected for consecutive two years as the Chair of the <a href="http://www.ieeensu.org/ieee-ras-sc/">IEEE North South University Student Branch, Robotics and Automation Society</a>, under the direction of <a href="http://ece.northsouth.edu/people/lamia-iftekhar/">Dr. Lamia Iftekhar</a>.

            Automation, computer vision, and vision-based control have always captured my interest since I was a freshman in college. I wanted to learn more, so I began working on Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Deep Neural Networks, and other fields of machine learning, where I developed classification systems for things like violent detection, child labor detection, and sexual harassment detection, among other things. After that, I was accepted as a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and was given the opportunity to work at the <a href="https://sites.uwm.edu/biorobotics-lab/">Biorobotics Lab</a> at UWM, where I am focusing on vision-based robot manipulation. In the lab, I'm also collaborating on mixed reality projects.
